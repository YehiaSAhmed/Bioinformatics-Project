## About
Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are the physical connections that exist between proteins in a cell. Understanding PPIs is crucial for comprehending cell physiology, and is also essential for drug development due to the potential impact of medications on PPIs.
## Features
* Building a biological network from the available interactome.
* The total path(s) score is calculated after finding the acyclic shrotest path(s) between two proteins.
* Give the weight for each path interaction(s).
* Drawing the sub-network created by these shortest path(s) between two proteins with *NetworkX* and *Matplotlib*.
* Determining the degree (number of connections) of each protein by identifying those that are connected to it.
* Listing all the interactions with all other proteins involving this particular protein along with their corresponding interaction weights.
* Creating a histogram to represent a group of proteins' degrees.
* Arranging these proteins in descending order of degree and saving the results in a text file.
* Giving a conversion map between the gene name(s) and the protein(s) UniProt's ID(s).
* Obtaining the adjacency matrix of the graph and saving it in a text file.
